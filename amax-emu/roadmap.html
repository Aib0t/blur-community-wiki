<h1>Amax Emu roadmap</h1>
<p>After 6 month in the making, from mid of December 2020 to 25th of May 2021, Amax Emu is finally released to the public. It's been a long journey, but even considering the amount of work I have done, it feels like I barely scratched the surface of “what is possible”, in terms of Blur modding, adjustments and fixes. So a lot of stuff is planned and, hopefully, coming.</p>
<h2>What to expect?&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Custom game modes</li>
  <li>In-game profile pictures</li>
  <li>Online leaderboards</li>
  <li>More game stats</li>
  <li>Better website</li>
  <li>Network connectivity fixes</li>
  <li>Game fixes</li>
  <li>Graphical adjustments</li>
  <li>Additional cars</li>
  <li>Textures upscaling</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

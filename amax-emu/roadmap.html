<h1>Amax Emu roadmap</h1>
<p>After 6 month in the making, from mid of December 2020 to 25th of May 2021, Amax Emu is finally released to the public. It's been a long journey, but even considering the amount of work I have done, it feels like I barely scratched the surface of “what is possible”, in terms of Blur modding, adjustments and fixes. So a lot of stuff is planned and, hopefully, coming.</p>
<h2>What to expect?&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Custom game modes</li>
  <li>In-game profile pictures</li>
  <li>Online leaderboards</li>
  <li>More game stats</li>
  <li>Better website</li>
  <li>Discord rich presence integration</li>
  <li>Network connectivity fixes</li>
  <li>Game fixes</li>
  <li>Graphical adjustments</li>
  <li>Additional cars</li>
  <li>Textures upscaling</li>
  <li>PS3 Crossplay</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to expect?</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that any and all dates stated here is a subject to change or cancellation, due to unforeseen events or unpredictable complications.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>June 2021</h3>
<h4>Online settings file editing</h4>
<p>When Blur client is making a connection to the online services it's supplied with “Online settings file”. This file contains a lot, if not all, online related settings, making it possible to adjust online mode in a huge variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Custom events - 1vs1, nitro only, etc</li>
  <li>Championship mode - Never used before online mode, which is still present in game</li>
  <li>Balance tweaks - Don't expect this, it just could be done</li>
  <li>Adjusting unlocks requirements</li>
  <li>Additional cars</li>
  <li>New post-race cars</li>
  <li>Fixes and tweaks</li>
</ul>
<h4>Online leaderboards</h4>
<p>In-game leaderboards are fine, but we can all agree that in 2021 we can do better. And we will!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>In-game profile pictures</h4>
<p>In-game profile pictures are present in every version of Blur, with an exception for PC version, where a part of code, responsible for it is cut. Currently, research of request, file format and binaries is done, so what is left is to re-implement it and build a backend for it.</p>
<h3>July 2021</h3>
<h4>Online connectivity fix</h4>
<p>In order to fix connection problems, caused by peer-to-peer nature of the game I'm planning to introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN server</a>. On paper, it should solve most, if not all, connectivity problems, at the cost of a higher ping between clients. This should work as plug-in solution, without any additional software required.</p>
<h4>Discord rich presence integration</h4>
<p>Coming to the Discord near you!</p>
<h4>More game stats</h4>
<p>Game is sending a lot of data back to the server after each race. And currently, 95% this data is unknown. This data should contain data about used mods, player car, paints, lap times and more. Correctly parsing such data can lead to a better, more personalized stats, as well as global usage stats.</p>
<h3>August 2021</h3>
<h4>Updated Amax Emu site</h4>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://amax-emu.com">https://amax-emu.com</a> is extremely bare bone version of what I want to implement. Most of the pages have already been designed, awaiting to be transformed to a proper ReactJS code.</p>

<h3>from September 2021 onwards</h3>
<h4>Game research</h4>
<p>Blur internals research, to make fixes possible, graphics adjustable and controls rebind-able.</p>
<h4>.model file format research</h4>
<p>In order to add-in new cars and adjust textures .model file formats needs to be researched.</p>
<h4>PS3 Crossplay</h4>
<p>More research required, but I think it's possible.</p>

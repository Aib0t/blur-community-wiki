<h2>How to beat drifters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pro tip for combating drifters: bolt at them when it looks like they're about to perform a drift, also you can catch a bump off a drifter ramming into you and using two nitros at once is an easy way to get top speed. hope these tips help<i><strong> - Adam1#5447</strong></i></li>
  <li>There are lots of ways to battle against a drifter. If you're able to become a tough player managing pretty good your power ups and your aiming, you'll get drifters behind you since lines are predictable mostly. There's no need to go for dirty tactics when trying to beat a drifter (actually going dirty makes you go slower and lose speed, therefore you lose the race) So I suggest to analyze drifters patters and once you have it clear, you'll notice sometimes it's easy to predict or at least have an idea. <i><strong>- SOUL-EΛTΞR#8244</strong></i></li>

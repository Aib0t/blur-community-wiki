<h2>Power-ups</h2>
<h3>Nitro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When going top speed and you're about to get reseted (getting out of bounds), you can aibrake seconds before the game resets you, so right after you get respawned as a ghost &nbsp;you'll have the same exact speed as before. &nbsp;<i><strong>- SOUL-EΛTΞR#8244</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Shock</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It can be used on purpose to reduce your speed when cornering at really high speed, when you're about to lose control. &nbsp;<i><strong>- SOUL-EΛTΞR#8244</strong></i></li>
  <li>When your only way is crashing into one lightning at top speed, use a nitro at the very same time you crash into it so the shock will push your speed a little bit upper rather than make you slower. Use this trick only when crashing into shock dome is unavoidable and you have kept a nitro, that could be strategically used for that. &nbsp;<i><strong>- SOUL-EΛTΞR#8244</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to beat drifters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pro tip for combating drifters: bolt at them when it looks like they're about to perform a drift, also you can catch a bump off a drifter ramming into you and using two nitros at once is an easy way to get top speed. hope these tips help<i><strong> - Adam1#5447</strong></i></li>
  <li>There are lots of ways to battle against a drifter. If you're able to become a tough player managing pretty good your power ups and your aiming, you'll get drifters behind you since lines are predictable mostly. There's no need to go for dirty tactics when trying to beat a drifter (actually going dirty makes you go slower and lose speed, therefore you lose the race) So I suggest to analyze drifters patters and once you have it clear, you'll notice sometimes it's easy to predict or at least have an idea. <i><strong>- SOUL-EΛTΞR#8244</strong></i></li>

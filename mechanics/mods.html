<h5>Notes:</h5>
<p><strong>Adaptive Shielding</strong> - Converts power-ups one to one e.g. if you was hit with a Shunt you will get a Shunt power-up and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Scrambler </strong>- Works for front fired Mines, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Field </strong>-<strong> </strong>Works great in Motor Mash</p>

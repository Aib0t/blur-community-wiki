<h1>Structure description</h1>
<p>The struct follows this scheme:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">01 00 * 00 * 00 00 00 + UNK REFERENCE + OBJECT ID + OBJECT TYPE REFERENCE</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UNK REFERENCE:</strong> Unknown reference possibly to another data type</li>
  <li><strong>OBJECT ID:</strong> The object ID used by the game’s database to identify it</li>
  <li><strong>OBJECT TYPE REFERENCE:</strong> Used to reference all objects of a single class</li>
  <li><strong>* [WILDCARD]:</strong> Can be multiple values. Unknown as of now what it actual meaning is</li>
</ul>
<h1>Brief example</h1>
<p>Here we have an example of how it looks like in memory using Cheat Engine and also where it is used. As we can see, all values follow the same structure as detailed above. All of these begin at the address (RealAddress) where they are being referenced later on in all of the game internal json files (blueprints).</p>
<p>At the same time we can gather this info from them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object with ID <code>C3 00 DD 58</code> is of type <code>60 C6 61 0A</code>. The object type has 221 occurences (objects) in the entire struct. The object is referenced at <code>0x0A6891F4</code></li>
  <li>Object with ID <code>44 B7 E9 58</code> is of type <code>A0 C5 61 0A</code>. The object type has 393 occurences (objects) in the entire struct. The object is referenced at <code>0x0A689208</code></li>
  <li>Object with ID <code>09 C3 F9 58</code> is of type <code>80 2E 62 0A</code>. The object type has 286 occurences (objects)&nbsp;in the entire struct. The object is referenced at <code>0x0A68921C</code></li>
</ul>

  &lt;CheatEntries&gt;
    &lt;CheatEntry&gt;
      &lt;ID&gt;19434&lt;/ID&gt;
      &lt;Description&gt;"No description"&lt;/Description&gt;
      &lt;LastState Value="01 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 54 E0 13 1B C3 00 DD 58 60 C6 61 0A" RealAddress="0A6891F4"/&gt;
      &lt;ShowAsHex&gt;1&lt;/ShowAsHex&gt;
      &lt;VariableType&gt;Array of byte&lt;/VariableType&gt;
      &lt;ByteLength&gt;20&lt;/ByteLength&gt;
      &lt;Address&gt;0A6891F4&lt;/Address&gt;
    &lt;/CheatEntry&gt;
    &lt;CheatEntry&gt;
      &lt;ID&gt;19435&lt;/ID&gt;
      &lt;Description&gt;"No description"&lt;/Description&gt;
      &lt;LastState Value="01 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 64 35 F6 17 44 B7 E9 58 A0 C5 61 0A" RealAddress="0A689208"/&gt;

    &lt;/CheatEntry&gt;
    &lt;CheatEntry&gt;

      &lt;ShowAsHex&gt;1&lt;/ShowAsHex&gt;
      &lt;VariableType&gt;Array of byte&lt;/VariableType&gt;

<h1>How to search for all objects of a type in CE</h1>
<p>All that is going to be explained here needs a lot of concentration and attention. You have been warned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many ways of getting the same result but I’m going to explain here what I think is the most simple.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to swap the Skybox Lighting from any track present in the game. First, get yourself its ID from the table I’ve made in this wiki. Let’s take <code>66 2F E4 00</code> which is the "LA Downtown Variant". Search for <code>66 2F E4 00</code> as Array of Bytes in CE. The result must be something very similar to this:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/object_struct/unknown1.png"></figure>
<p>Then you have to “build” the signature of the object type. Take the first 8 bytes of the start of the object reference which is <code>01 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 * * * * * * * *</code> and add whatever is next to the ID you searched for, i.e, <code>40 19 61 0A</code>.</p>
<p>You must end up with this: <code>01 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 * * * * * * * * 40 19 61 0A</code></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE: 40 19 61 0A is a memory address which means is gonna change every time you restart the game so you will have to redo the process all over again</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After building the AOB, you must search for it in CE. You must get something around 87 results. Now, select all the results and drag them into the address list by clicking in the red arrow button. Once done, copy all addresses from the address list and paste them into a text editor, preferebly Visual Studio Code or similar.</p>
<p>Now in order to swap the objects you just need to do a few steps. Search for its ID in the text editor, copy the address where it is located in the object struct and finally paste it into the address where it holds the reference (see next chapter).</p>

<h1>How to swap objects by reference in CE</h1>
<p>Let’s say you want to change the environment skybox from the Barcelona Oval track. You would have to search for the Environment Override ID of the track first as Array of Bytes. The correct memory region must look like this.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/object_struct/unknown.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>BLUE</strong>: Environment Override ID</li>
  <li><strong>RED</strong>: Environment Skybox Object Reference</li>
  <li><strong>GREEN</strong>: Environment Lighting Object Reference</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the next step is to add it to the address list.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/object_struct/1.png"></figure>
<p>Once you have in the address list, you must change its type to 4 Bytes and Hexadecimal format. Finally, you must change its value with the new address from the object you want to swap it with.</p>

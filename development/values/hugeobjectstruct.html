<p>The struct follows this scheme:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">01 00 * 00 * 00 00 00 + UNK REFERENCE + OBJECT ID + OBJECT TYPE REFERENCE</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UNK REFERENCE:</strong> Unknown reference of other data type</li>
  <li><strong>OBJECT ID:</strong> The object id used by the gameâ€™s database to identify it</li>
  <li><strong>OBJECT TYPE REFERENCE:</strong> Used to reference all objects part of a single class</li>
  <li><strong>* :</strong> Wildcard. Can be multiple values. Unknown as of now what is its actual meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

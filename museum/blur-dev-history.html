<ol>
  <li>“Mad Max”/Neon PGR stage - pre-pre-production stage of development.</li>
  <li>Orange stage - game featured orange UI and main story was still intact.</li>

<h2>Late 2007</h2>
<p><strong>26 September 2007</strong> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409031418/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bizarre-acquired-by-activision">publisher <i>Activision acquired Bizarre Creations</i>.</a> for $107.4m; $67.4m immediately payable with a further $40m contingent hitting certain goals over a 5-year period.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Activision's independent studio model will continue giving us creative freedom to build exciting new brands. Their financial support and marketing prowess will also enable us to build upon the commercial success that we currently enjoy, and take the company - and our games - to an even higher level."</p>

<h2>Early 2008</h2>
<p><strong>Late 2007 - Early 2008 - </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106191647/http://www.bizarrecreations.com/article.php?article_id=5345"><u>Development of Blur begins.</u></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, we can talk about Blur! It seems like ages since we started on this one, and it's a great relief to finally tell you guys what we're working on! If you're a long time Bizarre community member you're probably used to these periods of relative silence from the studio - we're running dark whilst everybody in the building is fully heads down on the next big thing. We've been working hard on this new racer <strong>pretty much as soon as we finished up on PGR4</strong>, joining forces with Activision on the way.<strong> It's been a long year or so!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We weren't an independent studio making 'our' games anymore - <strong>we were making games to fill slots</strong>. Although we did believe in them, they were more the products of committees and analysts. The culture we’d worked on for so long gradually eroded just enough so that it wasn’t ‘ours’ anymore."</p>

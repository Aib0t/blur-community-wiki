<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Blur 1 and 2 had a troubled, obscure and <i><u>bizarre</u></i> development. This article is an attempt to preserve any and all information, related to Blur 1 and 2 “making of” story, using every piece of info available. There will be mentions of events, cut features and less known things about Blur 1 and 2 development.</p>
<p>In short - Blur development went thought 3 major stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Mad Max”/Neon PGR stage - pre-pre-production stage of development.</li>
  <li>Orange stage - game featured orange UI and main story was still intact.</li>
  <li>Blur stage - game featured blue UI and main story was removed.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Blur 1</h1>
<h2>Late 2007</h2>
<p><strong>26 September 2007</strong> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409031418/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bizarre-acquired-by-activision">publisher <i>Activision acquired Bizarre Creations</i>.</a> for $107.4m; $67.4m immediately payable with a further $40m contingent hitting certain goals over a 5-year period.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Activision's independent studio model will continue giving us creative freedom to build exciting new brands. Their financial support and marketing prowess will also enable us to build upon the commercial success that we currently enjoy, and take the company - and our games - to an even higher level."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Early 2008</h2>
<p><strong>Late 2007 - Early 2008 - </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106191647/http://www.bizarrecreations.com/article.php?article_id=5345"><u>Development of Blur begins.</u></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, we can talk about Blur! It seems like ages since we started on this one, and it's a great relief to finally tell you guys what we're working on! If you're a long time Bizarre community member you're probably used to these periods of relative silence from the studio - we're running dark whilst everybody in the building is fully heads down on the next big thing. We've been working hard on this new racer <strong>pretty much as soon as we finished up on PGR4</strong>, joining forces with Activision on the way.<strong> It's been a long year or so!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We weren't an independent studio making 'our' games anymore - <strong>we were making games to fill slots</strong>. Although we did believe in them, they were more the products of committees and analysts. The culture we’d worked on for so long gradually eroded just enough so that it wasn’t ‘ours’ anymore."</p>

<h2>Mid 2008</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IGN: After so many years working on Project Gotham, were you getting tired of the franchise, and is this a game that everyone at Bizarre had wanted to make for some time?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Gareth Wilson:</strong> I think we wanted to make something different. When we finished PGR we didn't think 'let's make a crazy game with lightbeams and characters that talk to you' - there wasn't this grand vision at all. To be totally honest, we started and we thought we needed to make a more exciting Gotham. We started experimenting with lots of cars and we almost had this Days of Thunder, Nascar vibe – and it was better because there was overtaking and lots of car to car stuff, but it still wasn't as exciting as it could be. So we started thinking about having some special abilities to add some strategy to it.</p>
  <p>We put those in, but it still wasn't really doing it – it was too subtle. That's when the power-ups came along and it was a very organic process. We didn't really have a clue what we wanted to make after Gotham but one thing we knew was that we wanted to make it appeal to more people.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>“Mad Max” stage</h3>
<p>Earliest concepts available was created during this time. They show destruction derby style of tracks and almost post-apocalyptic aesthetic. No bonuses was introduced at this point in development.</p>
<h4><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409035346if_/https://aidanward.carbonmade.com/projects/4562021">Aidan Ward illustrations</a>, who during that time was responsible for “<i>…creating preliminary mood concept art…</i>”.</h4>

<h3>"Neon PGR" stage</h3>
<p>Not much known about this stage of development, since only one source of artworks is available. Despite little to none information available, core ideas of Blur design can be clearly seen - light flares, neon lights and colorful cars.</p>
<p>Distinctive team paint jobs on each car could be noticed, suggesting that "team-based racing" theme was researched at that time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Late 2008</h2>
<h3>Racebook</h3>

<p>Lot’s of work was done towards “social network” aspect of the game, called “<strong>Racebook</strong>”. “Racebook” was a in-game UI, stylized as a social network.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>All the characters in the game are connected to a social network (jokingly called, variously, 'Racebook', 'MyRace', and 'InnerTube'), which is essentially the game interface. It works as you'd expect, with race invitations, fan tracking, your car catalogue, all that stuff. But it doesn't look like your stats will upload to <i>actual</i> Facebook or anything like that. It's just a game mode. There <i>is</i> a separate one for multiplayer for sharing in-game photos etc, but there's no word on whether that will have a web presence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once online the player will encounter what Bizarre Creations have dubbed "<strong>Racebook</strong>"(a racing version of Facebook). Here, the user can create an account and join any of the fictional servers in the career. Each mode can be altered how the player sees fit (number of laps, assists, no. of power-ups, team races etc.) and can share these options with friends they make over the service. These races can be played in teams and the matches can be altered to support certain power-ups, cars, tracks and other variables.</p>

<p>Which was scrapped in the end, maintaining only small fraction of the planned features.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Back to Blur, one aspect of the game that is interesting is that you have parodied various popular social networks – with things like ‘Racebook’ and ‘InnerTube’.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Gareth Wilson: </strong>Yeah, this is something which – when the game was delayed last year and we had a bit of a re-set – we realized, to be straight with you, that we just hadn’t had enough time to come up with enough good new ideas… what with the PGR4 stuff dragging out and other things. 18 or 20 months just wasn’t long enough to make a new IP.</p>
  <p>So when we had that re-set this idea of putting social networking into the game… well, technology just caught up with us really. And towards the end of the game’s development we were talking with all the social networking vendors, really, who wanted us to put Twitter and all of that sort of stuff in there.</p>

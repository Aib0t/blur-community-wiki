<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Blur 1 and 2 had a troubled, obscure and <i><u>bizarre</u></i> development. This article is an attempt to preserve any and all information, related to Blur 1 and 2 “making of” story, using every piece of info available. There will be mentions of events, cut features and less known things about Blur 1 and 2 development.</p>
<p>In short - Blur development went thought 3 major stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Mad Max”/Neon PGR stage - pre-pre-production stage of development.</li>
  <li>Orange stage - game featured orange UI and main story was still intact.</li>
  <li>Blur stage - game featured blue UI and main story was removed.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Blur 1</h1>
<h2>Late 2007</h2>
<p><strong>26 September 2007</strong> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409031418/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bizarre-acquired-by-activision">publisher <i>Activision acquired Bizarre Creations</i>.</a> for $107.4m; $67.4m immediately payable with a further $40m contingent hitting certain goals over a 5-year period.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Activision's independent studio model will continue giving us creative freedom to build exciting new brands. Their financial support and marketing prowess will also enable us to build upon the commercial success that we currently enjoy, and take the company - and our games - to an even higher level."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Early 2008</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, we can talk about Blur! It seems like ages since we started on this one, and it's a great relief to finally tell you guys what we're working on! If you're a long time Bizarre community member you're probably used to these periods of relative silence from the studio - we're running dark whilst everybody in the building is fully heads down on the next big thing. We've been working hard on this new racer <strong>pretty much as soon as we finished up on PGR4</strong>, joining forces with Activision on the way.<strong> It's been a long year or so!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We weren't an independent studio making 'our' games anymore - <strong>we were making games to fill slots</strong>. Although we did believe in them, they were more the products of committees and analysts. The culture we’d worked on for so long gradually eroded just enough so that it wasn’t ‘ours’ anymore."</p>

<h2>Mid 2008</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IGN: After so many years working on Project Gotham, were you getting tired of the franchise, and is this a game that everyone at Bizarre had wanted to make for some time?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Gareth Wilson:</strong> I think we wanted to make something different. When we finished PGR we didn't think 'let's make a crazy game with lightbeams and characters that talk to you' - there wasn't this grand vision at all. To be totally honest, we started and we thought we needed to make a more exciting Gotham. We started experimenting with lots of cars and we almost had this Days of Thunder, Nascar vibe – and it was better because there was overtaking and lots of car to car stuff, but it still wasn't as exciting as it could be. So we started thinking about having some special abilities to add some strategy to it.</p>
  <p>We put those in, but it still wasn't really doing it – it was too subtle. That's when the power-ups came along and it was a very organic process. We didn't really have a clue what we wanted to make after Gotham but one thing we knew was that we wanted to make it appeal to more people.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>“Mad Max” stage</h3>
<p>Earliest concepts available was created during this time. They show destruction derby style of tracks and almost post-apocalyptic aesthetic. No bonuses was introduced at this point in development.</p>
<h4><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409035346if_/https://aidanward.carbonmade.com/projects/4562021">Aidan Ward illustrations</a>, who during that time was responsible for “<i>…creating preliminary mood concept art…</i>”.</h4>

<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:49.99%;"><img src="/assets/timeline_files/vince_blur1.jpeg"></figure>
<h3>"Neon PGR" stage</h3>
<p>Not much known about this stage of development, since only one source of artworks is available. Despite little to none information available, core ideas of Blur design can be clearly seen - light flares, neon lights and colorful cars.</p>
<p>Distinctive team paint jobs on each car could be noticed, suggesting that "team-based racing" theme was researched at that time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Late 2008</h2>
<h3>Racebook</h3>

</figure>
<p>Lot’s of work was done towards “social network” aspect of the game, called “<strong>Racebook</strong>”. “Racebook” was a in-game UI, stylized as a social network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, RaceBook was planned not only as in-game UI, but also as a narrative tool, laying out the story in the format of stories, social networks posts and comments. With banter from NPC included.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

  </figure>
  <p>All the characters in the game are connected to a social network (jokingly called, variously, 'Racebook', 'MyRace', and 'InnerTube'), which is essentially the game interface. It works as you'd expect, with race invitations, fan tracking, your car catalogue, all that stuff. But it doesn't look like your stats will upload to <i>actual</i> Facebook or anything like that. It's just a game mode. There <i>is</i> a separate one for multiplayer for sharing in-game photos etc, but there's no word on whether that will have a web presence.</p>
  <p><strong>Edge magazine (issue 202) - June 2009&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once online the player will encounter what Bizarre Creations have dubbed "<strong>Racebook</strong>"(a racing version of Facebook). Here, the user can create an account and join any of the fictional servers in the career. Each mode can be altered how the player sees fit (number of laps, assists, no. of power-ups, team races etc.) and can share these options with friends they make over the service. These races can be played in teams and the matches can be altered to support certain power-ups, cars, tracks and other variables.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Which was scrapped in the end, maintaining only small fraction of the planned features. It's not clear, if it was scrapped as a part of mid 2009 rework and was a result of removal of story-driven singleplayer or was really scraped as a result of bad planning.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Back to Blur, one aspect of the game that is interesting is that you have parodied various popular social networks – with things like ‘Racebook’ and ‘InnerTube’.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Gareth Wilson: </strong>Yeah, this is something which – when the game was delayed last year and we had a bit of a re-set – we realized, to be straight with you, that we just hadn’t had enough time to come up with enough good new ideas… what with the PGR4 stuff dragging out and other things. 18 or 20 months just wasn’t long enough to make a new IP.</p>
  <p>So when we had that re-set this idea of putting social networking into the game… well, technology just caught up with us really. And towards the end of the game’s development we were talking with all the social networking vendors, really, who wanted us to put Twitter and all of that sort of stuff in there.</p>

<p><strong>4 December 2008 - </strong>First ever mention of Blur happened in the article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409034132/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/activision-signs-18-game-ad-deal-with-massive"><strong>“Activision signs 18-game ad deal with Massive”</strong></a></p>

  <p>The deal with Activision is primarily focused is on in-game ads however, and covers Xbox 360 and PC titles, including Tony Hawk games, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and <strong>AMAX Racing</strong>.</p>

<p>Amax Racing was internal name for Blur during its early development days. The name “Amax” is referenced a lot of in in-game internal strings and files. Also, leftover logo exists.</p>

<h2>Early 2009</h2>
<p><strong>February 12 2009</strong> - Activision announce unnamed racing game from Bizarre Creations.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Activision announced today during an annual financial call that the makers of the Project Gotham series are hard at work on a brand new, yet-to-be-named racing property.</p>
  <p>We've heard from a source close to the studio that the new game from Bizarre Creations will have a serious arcade slant with emphasis being put on grabbing power-ups and over-the-top action. That withstanding, the racing will still feature brand-name vehicles.</p>
  <p>No release date or specifics were officially released during the call.</p>

<p><strong>May 19 2009</strong> - Blur is announced. This marks the begging of "Orange" stage of development.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Activision Publishing (Nasdaq: ATVI) is set to revolutionize the racing genre with the debut of Bizarre Creations' newest project, <i><strong>Blur</strong></i>™ -- the ultimate wheel-to-wheel racing action experience.</p>

<p>A lot of materials was released around that date to promote the announcement - several articles in magazines, online hands-on reviews and numerous others.</p>
<p><strong>It should be noted that game was very different from the final product and many interviews before September of 2009 referencing cut features, mechanics and completely removed single player campaign.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A mob of neon-clad kids wave glowsticks as they gather on the bridge over Shoreditch High Street, the light projectors they've set up describing flashing chevrons on the barfronts of East London's self-professed capital of cool. They're here to see an ad-lib street race, having found details of the event through a Facebook for petrolheads and, on-cue, a gaggle of cars race up Hackney Road to Haggerston Park, leaving bright phosphorous trails in their wake. Forget what you might have read; this isn't simply Forza meets Mario Kart, it's Project Gotham gone Nu Rave.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only a few screenshots from this time exists. An earliest know version of HUD can be seen with completely different layout, single bonus slot (slots were purchasable unlocks back in this stage of development) and lack of minimap.&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Assists system is present</li>
  <li>You can see other players on the minimap</li>
  <li>Shield has its hit-points visible</li>
  <li>Lock-on functionality</li>

<p>&nbsp;During early stages of development there was an assist system, aimed to help new players with adjusting to the game driving model. In the end, this idea was &nbsp;removed from the game, but icons for this system are still present in game files.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quite simply the more strategically you use or shield power-ups on-track, the more fans and then <strong>money</strong> you gain. Fans and money is the replacement reward system for Kudos in PGR. Kudos was great, but we really wanted to offer a little more in terms of positive acknowledgement (it is reward system after all!). The idea is; the <strong>more money you gain, the more cool upgrades you can purchase from our in game shop for your power-ups.</strong> You'll also be glad to know that each of the five power-ups we have in our current build are individually distinctive and will FINALLY aid in kicking some serious AI ass!!</p>
